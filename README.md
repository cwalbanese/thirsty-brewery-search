## About

This web based application utilizes an API to search through a database of breweries, cideries, brewpubs, and bottleshops across the United States. There are two ways to narrow your results, by name/keyword or city/town. I chose to use a brewery API because I got married at a brewery and thought it would be a fun project.

## Technology

The technologies used for this project are HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, and React.

## Planning

Before I could start the project, I needed to plan it first. I accomplished this by hand drawing wireframes and component hierarchy trees. This helped me visualize what I needed to do to build this project and where to start with my code.

I also took some time to write some user stories to help me get a feel for the type of UX that should be provided.

-   As a user, I am interested in finding local breweries, cideries, brewpubs, and bottleshops.
-   As a user, I would like to search by name or by city/town.
-   As a user, I would like to see information like street address or a website url.
